## Summary

Ledisdb use redis protocol called RESP(REdis Serialization Protocol), [here](http://redis.io/topics/protocol).

Ledisdb all commands return RESP format and it will use `int64` instead of  `RESP integer`, `string` instead of `RESP simple string`, `bulk string` instead of `RESP bulk string`, and `array` instead of `RESP arrays` below.

Most of the Ledisdb's commands are the same as Redis's, you can see the redis commands document for detailed information too.

## List

### BLPOP key [key ...] timeout

BLPOP is a blocking list pop primitive. It is the blocking version of LPOP because it blocks the connection when there are no elements to pop from any of the given lists. An element is popped from the head of the first list that is non-empty, with the given keys being checked in the order that they are given.

When BLPOP causes a client to block and a non-zero timeout is specified, the client will unblock returning a nil multi-bulk value when the specified timeout has expired.
The timeout argument is interpreted as an double value specifying the maximum number of seconds to block. You can use 0.005 format to support milliseconds timeout.

A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

BLPOP and BRPOP can not work correctly in transaction now!

**Return value**

array: 

+ A nil multi-bulk when no element could be popped and the timeout expired.
+ A two-element multi-bulk with the first element being the name of the key where an element was popped and the second element being the value of the popped element.

**Examples**
```
ledis> RPUSH list1 a b c
(integer) 3
ledis> BLPOP list1 list2 0
1) "list1"
2) "a"
```

### BRPOP key [key ...] timeout

See [BLPOP key [key ...] timeout](#blpop-key-key--timeout) for more information.

### BRPOPLPUSH source destination timeout
BRPOPLPUSH is the blocking variant of [RPOPLPUSH](#rpoplpush-source-destination).
When source contains elements, this command behaves exactly like RPOPLPUSH.
Redis will block the connection until another client pushes to it or until timeout is reached.
A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

### LINDEX key index
Returns the element at index index in the list stored at key. The index is zero-based, so 0 means the first element, 1 the second element and so on. Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the list. Here, `-1` means the last element, `-2` means the penultimate and so forth.
When the value at key is not a list, an error is returned.

**Return value**

string: the requested element, or `nil` when index is out of range.

**Examples**

```
ledis> RPUSH a 1 2 3
(integer) 3
ledis> LINDEX a 0
1
ledis> LINDEX a 1
2
ledis> LINDEX a 2
3
ledis> LINDEX a 3
(nil)
ledis> LINDEX a -1
3
```

### LLEN key
Returns the length of the list stored at key. If key does not exist, it is interpreted as an empty list and `0`is returned. An error is returned when the value stored at key is not a list.

**Return value**

int64: the length of the list at key.

**Examples**

```
ledis> RPUSH a 'foo'
(integer) 1
ledis> RPUSH a 'bar'
(integer) 2
ledis> LLEN a
(integer) 2
```

### LPOP key
Removes and returns the first element of the list stored at key.

**Return value**

bulk: the value of the first element, or `nil` when key does not exist.

**Examples**

```
ledis> RPUSH a 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> RPUSH a 'two'
(integer) 2
ledis> RPUSH a 'three'
(integer) 3
ledis> LPOP a
one
```

### LRANGE key start stop
Returns the specified elements of the list stored at key. The offsets start and stop are zero-based indexes, with 0 being the first element of the list (the head of the list), `1` being the next element and so on.

**Return value**

array: list of elements in the specified range.

**Examples**

```
ledis> RPUSH a 'one' 'two' 'three'
(integer) 3
ledis> LRANGE a 0 0
1) "one"
ledis> LRANGE a -100 100
1) "one"
2) "two"
3) "three"
ledis> LRANGE a -3 2
1) "one"
2) "two"
3) "three"
ledis> LRANGE a 0 -1
(empty list or set)
```

### LPUSH key value [value ...]
Insert all the specified values at the head of the list stored at key. If key does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations. When key holds a value that is not a list, an error is returned.

**Return value**

int64: the length of the list after the push operations.

**Examples**

```
ledis> LPUSH a 1
(integer) 1
ledis> LPUSH a 2
(integer) 2
ledis> LRANGE a 0 2
1) "2"
2) "1"
```

### RPOP key
Removes and returns the last element of the list stored at key.

**Return value**

bulk: the value of the last element, or `nil` when key does not exist.

**Examples**

```
edis > RPUSH a 1
(integer) 1
ledis> RPUSH a 2
(integer) 2
ledis> RPUSH a 3
(integer) 3
ledis> RPOP a
3
ledis> LRANGE a 0 3
1) "1"
2) "2"
```

### RPOPLPUSH source destination
Atomically returns and removes the last element (tail) of the list stored at source, and pushes the element at the first element (head) of the list stored at destination.

For example: consider source holding the list a,b,c, and destination holding the list x,y,z. Executing RPOPLPUSH results in source holding a,b and destination holding c,x,y,z.

If source does not exist, the value nil is returned and no operation is performed.
If source and destination are the same, the operation is equivalent to removing the last element from the list and pushing it as first element of the list, so it can be considered as a list rotation command.

### RPUSH key value [value ...]
Insert all the specified values at the tail of the list stored at key. If key does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operation. When key holds a value that is not a list, an error is returned.

**Return value**

int64: the length of the list after the push operation.

**Examples**

```
ledis>  RPUSH a 'hello'
(integer) 1
ledis> RPUSH a 'world'
(integer) 2
ledis> LRANGE a 0 2
1) "hello"
2) "world"
```

### LCLEAR key

**Return value**

int64: the number of values in the list stored at key

**Examples**

```
ledis> RPUSH a 1 2 3
(integer) 3
ledis> LLEN a
(integer) 3
ledis> LCLEAR a
(integer) 3
ledis> LLEN a
(integer) 0
```

key1 = {a,b,c,d}
key2 = {c}
key3 = {a,c,e}
SINTER key1 key2 key3 = {c}
```

Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets. With one of the keys being an empty set, the resulting set is also empty (since set intersection with an empty set always results in an empty set).

**Return value**

bulk: list with members of the resulting set.

**Examples**

```
ledis> SADD key1 a b c 
(integer) 3
ledis> SADD key2 c d e

(integer) 1
ledis> SADD myset world
(integer) 1
ledis> SMEMBERS myset
1) "hello"
2) "world"
```

### SREM  key member [member ...]

Remove the specified members from the set stored at key. Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored. If key does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns 0.

**Return value**

int64: the number of members that were removed from the set, not including non existing members.

## ZSet

### ZADD key score member [score member ...]
Adds all the specified members with the specified scores to the sorted set stored at key. It is possible to specify multiple `score / member` pairs. If a specified member is already a member of the sorted set, the score is updated and the element reinserted at the right position to ensure the correct ordering.

If key does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified members as sole members is created, like if the sorted set was empty. If the key exists but does not hold a sorted set, an error is returned.

The score values should be the string representation of an `int64` number. `+inf` and `-inf` values are valid values as well.

**Currently, we only support int64 type, not double type.**

**Return value**

int64, specifically:

The number of elements added to the sorted sets, **not** including elements already existing for which the score was updated.


**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'uno'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two' 3 'three'

(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'uno'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two' 3 'three'

8) "3"
ledis> ZCARD myzset
(integer) 4
```

### ZCOUNT key min max
Returns the number of elements in the sorted set at key with a score between `min` and `max`.
The `min` and `max` arguments have the same semantic as described for `ZRANGEBYSCORE`.

**Return value**

int64: the number of elements in the specified score range.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'uno'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two' 3 'three'

4) "1"
5) "two"
6) "2"
7) "three"
8) "3"
ledis> ZCOUNT myzset -inf +inf
(integer) 4
ledis> ZCOUNT myzset (1 3
(integer) 2
```

### ZINCRBY key increment member

Increments the score of member in the sorted set stored at key by increment. If member does not exist in the sorted set, it is added with increment as its score (as if its previous score was 0). If key does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified member as its sole member is created.
An error is returned when key exists but does not hold a sorted set.
The score value should be the string representation of a numeric value. It is possible to provide a negative value to decrement the score.

**Return value**

bulk: the new score of member (an int64 number), represented as string.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZINCRBY myzset 2 'one'
3

1) "two"
2) "2"
3) "one"
4) "3"
```

### ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]

2) "three"
```

### ZRANGEBYSCORE key min max [WITHSCORES] [LIMIT offset count]

Returns all the elements in the sorted set at key with a score between `min` and `max` (including elements with score equal to `min` or `max`). The elements are considered to be ordered from low to high scores.

**Exclusive intervals and infinity**

`min` and `max` can be `-inf` and `+inf`, so that you are not required to know the highest or lowest score in the sorted set to get all elements from or up to a certain score.
By default, the interval specified by min and max is closed (inclusive). It is possible to specify an open interval (exclusive) by prefixing the score with the character (. For example:

```
ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (1 5
```

Will return all elements with 1 < score <= 5 while:

```
ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (5 (10
```

Will return all the elements with 5 < score < 10 (5 and 10 excluded).


**Return value**

array: list of elements in the specified score range (optionally with their scores).

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 3 'three'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset -inf +inf WITHSCORES

2) "1"
3) "two"
4) "2"
5) "three"
6) "3"

2) "3"
ledis> ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset (1 2 WITHSCORES
1) "two"
2) "2"
ledis> ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset (1 (2 WITHSCORES
```

### ZRANK key member
Returns the rank of member in the sorted set stored at key, with the scores ordered from low to high. The rank (or index) is `0-based`, which means that the member with the lowest score has rank 0.

**Return value**

Return value

- If member exists in the sorted set, Integer reply: the rank of member.
- If member does not exist in the sorted set or key does not exist, Bulk string reply: nil.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 'one'
(integer) 1
ledis> ZADD myzset 2 'two'
(integer) 1

An error is returned when key exists and does not hold a sorted set.

**Return value**

int64 reply, specifically:

The number of members removed from the sorted set, not including non existing members.

**Examples**

4) "four"
ledis> ZREM myzset three
(integer) 1
ledis> ZREM myzset one four three
(integer) 2
```

### ZREMRANGEBYRANK key start stop
Removes all elements in the sorted set stored at key with rank between start and stop. Both start and stop are 0 -based indexes with 0 being the element with the lowest score. These indexes can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at the element with the highest score. For example: -1 is the element with the highest score, -2 the element with the second highest score and so forth.

**Return value**

int64: the number of elements removed.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 one 2 two 3 three 4 four

### ZREVRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]
Returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set stored at key. The elements are considered to be ordered from the highest to the lowest score. Descending lexicographical order is used for elements with equal score.
Apart from the reversed ordering, ZREVRANGE is similar to `ZRANGE`.

**Return value**

array: list of elements in the specified range (optionally with their scores).

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 one 2 two 3 three 4 four
(integer) 4
ledis> ZREVRANGE myzset 0 -1
1) "four"
2) "three"
3) "two"
4) "one"
```

### ZREVRANGEBYSCORE  key max min [WITHSCORES] [LIMIT offset count]
Returns all the elements in the sorted set at key with a score between max and min (including elements with score equal to max or min). In contrary to the default ordering of sorted sets, for this command the elements are considered to be ordered from high to low scores.
The elements having the same score are returned in reverse lexicographical order.
Apart from the reversed ordering, ZREVRANGEBYSCORE is similar to ZRANGEBYSCORE.

**Return value**

array: list of elements in the specified score range (optionally with their scores).

**Examples**

```
ledis>  ZADD myzset 1 one 2 two 3 three 4 four
(integer) 4
ledis> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE myzset +inf -inf
1) "four"
2) "three"
3) "two"
4) "one"
ledis> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE myzset 2 1
1) "two"
2) "one"
ledis> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE myzset 2 (1
1) "two"
ledis> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE myzset (2 (1
(empty list or set)
ledis> ZREVRANGEBYSCORE myzset +inf -inf WITHSCORES LIMIT 1 2
1) "three"
2) "3"
3) "two"
4) "2"
```

### ZREVRANK key member
Returns the rank of member in the sorted set stored at key, with the scores ordered from high to low. The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the highest score has rank 0.
Use ZRANK to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from low to high.

**Return value**

- If member exists in the sorted set, Integer reply: the rank of member.
- If member does not exist in the sorted set or key does not exist, Bulk string reply: nil.


**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 1 one
(integer) 1

```

### ZUNIONSTORE destination numkeys key [key ...] [WEIGHTS weight [weight ...]] [AGGREGATE SUM|MIN|MAX]

Computes the union of numkeys sorted sets given by the specified keys, and stores the result in destination. It is mandatory to provide the number of input keys (numkeys) before passing the input keys and the other (optional) arguments.

By default, the resulting score of an element is the sum of its scores in the sorted sets where it exists.
Using the WEIGHTS option, it is possible to specify a multiplication factor for each input sorted set. This means that the score of every element in every input sorted set is multiplied by this factor before being passed to the aggregation function. When WEIGHTS is not given, the multiplication factors default to 1.

With the AGGREGATE option, it is possible to specify how the results of the union are aggregated. This option defaults to SUM, where the score of an element is summed across the inputs where it exists. When this option is set to either MIN or MAX, the resulting set will contain the minimum or maximum score of an element across the inputs where it exists.

If destination already exists, it is overwritten.


**Return value**

int64: the number of elements in the resulting sorted set at destination.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD zset1 1 "one"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset1 2 "two"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 1 "one"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 2 "two"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 3 "three"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZUNIONSTORE out 2 zset1 zset2 WEIGHTS 2 3
(interger) 3
ledis> ZRANGE out 0 -1 WITHSCORES
1) "one"
2) "5"
3) "three"
4) "9"
5) "two"
6) "10"
```

### ZINTERSTORE destination numkeys key [key ...] [WEIGHTS weight [weight ...]] [AGGREGATE SUM|MIN|MAX]

Computes the intersection of numkeys sorted sets given by the specified keys, and stores the result in destination. It is mandatory to provide the number of input keys (numkeys) before passing the input keys and the other (optional) arguments.

By default, the resulting score of an element is the sum of its scores in the sorted sets where it exists. Because intersection requires an element to be a member of every given sorted set, this results in the score of every element in the resulting sorted set to be equal to the number of input sorted sets.

For a description of the `WEIGHTS` and `AGGREGATE` options, see [ZUNIONSTORE](#zunionstore-destination-numkeys-key-key--weights-weight-weight--aggregate-summinmax).

If destination already exists, it is overwritten.



**Return value**

int64: the number of elements in the resulting sorted set at destination.

**Examples**

```
ledis> ZADD zset1 1 "one"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset1 2 "two"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 1 "one"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 2 "two"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZADD zset2 3 "three"
(interger) 1
ledis> ZINTERSTORE out 2 zset1 zset2 WEIGHTS 2 3
(interger) 3
ledis> ZRANGE out 0 -1 WITHSCORES
1) "one"
2) "5"
3) "two"
4) "10"
```

### ZRANGEBYLEX key min max [LIMIT offset count]

When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command returns all the elements in the sorted set at key with a value between min and max.

If the elements in the sorted set have different scores, the returned elements are unspecified.

Valid start and stop must start with ( or [, in order to specify if the range item is respectively exclusive or inclusive. The special values of + or - for start and stop have the special meaning or positively infinite and negatively infinite strings, so for instance the command ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - + is guaranteed to return all the elements in the sorted set, if all the elements have the same score.

**Return value**

array: list of elements in the specified score range

**Example**

```
ledis> ZADD myzset 0 a 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e 0 f 0 g
(integer) 7
ledis> ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - [c
1) "a"
2) "b"

## Replication

### SLAVEOF host port [RESTART] [READONLY]

Changes the replication settings of a slave on the fly. If the server is already acting as slave, `SLAVEOF NO ONE` will turn off the replication and turn the server into master. `SLAVEOF NO ONE READONLY` will turn the server into master with readonly mode. 

If the server is already master, `SLAVEOF NO ONE READONLY` will force the server to readonly mode, and `SLAVEOF NO ONE` will disable readonly.

`SLAVEOF host port` will make the server a slave of another server listening at the specified host and port.

If a server is already a slave of a master, `SLAVEOF host port` will stop the replication against the old and start the synchronization against the new one, if RESTART is set, it will discard the old dataset, otherwise it will sync with LastLogID + 1. 


### FULLSYNC [NEW]

Inner command, starts a fullsync from the master set by SLAVEOF.

FULLSYNC will first try to sync all data from the master, save in local disk, then discard old dataset and load new one.

`FULLSYNC NEW` will generate a new snapshot and sync, otherwise it will use the latest existing snapshot if possible.

**Return value**

**Examples**


### SYNC logid

Inner command, syncs the new changed from master set by SLAVEOF with logid.

**Return value**

**Examples**

## Server

```
ledis> PING
PONG
ledis> PING
dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6665: connection refused
ledis>
```

### ECHO message

Returns message.

**Return value**

bulk string reply

**Examples**

```
ledis> ECHO "hello"
hello
```

### SELECT index
Select the DB with having the specified zero-based numeric index. New connections always use DB `0`. Currently, We support `16` DBs(`0-15`).

**Return value**

Simple string reply

**Examples**

```
ledis> SELECT 2
OK
ledis> SELECT 15
OK
ledis> SELECT 16
ERR invalid db index 16
```

### FLUSHALL

Delete all the keys of all the existing databases and replication logs, not just the currently selected one. This command never fails.

Very dangerous to use!!!

### FLUSHDB

Delete all the keys of the currently selected DB. This command never fails.

Very dangerous to use!!!

### INFO [section]

Return information and statistic about the server in a format that is simple to parse by computers and easy to read by humans.

The optional parameter can be used to select a specific section of information. When no parameter is provided, all will return.

### TIME

The TIME command returns the current server time as a two items lists: a Unix timestamp and the amount of microseconds already elapsed in the current second

**Return value**

array: two elements, one is unix time in seconds, the other is microseconds.

### CONFIG REWRITE

Rewrites the config file the server was started with. 

**Unlike Redis rewrite, it will discard all comments in origin config file.**

**Return value**

String: OK or error msg.

### RESTORE key ttl value 

Create a key associated with a value that is obtained by deserializing the provided serialized value (obtained via DUMP, LDUMP, HDUMP, SDUMP, ZDUMP).

If ttl is 0 the key is created without any expire, otherwise the specified expire time (in milliseconds) is set. But you must know that now the checking ttl accuracy is second.

RESTORE checks the RDB version and data checksum. If they don't match an error is returned.

### ROLE

Provide information on the role of an intance in the context of replication. 

Role: master and slave

Master output:

```
1) "master"

5. The slave current replication binlog id.

## Script

LedisDB's script is refer to Redis, you can see more [http://redis.io/commands/eval](http://redis.io/commands/eval)

You must notice that executing lua will block any other write operations.

Both "ledis" and "redis" can be used call commands in the Lua script:

- ledis.call()
- redis.call()
- ledis.pcall()
- redis.pcall()
- ledis.sha1hex()
- redis.sha1hex()
- ledis.status_reply()
- redis.status_reply()
- ledis.error_reply()
- redis.error_reply()
 
EVALSHA command returns error message without "NOSCRIPT " prefix, so redigo users should preload script explicitly.

### EVAL script numkeys key [key ...] arg [arg ...]

### EVALSHA sha1 numkeys key [key ...] arg [arg ...]

### SCRIPT LOAD script

### SCRIPT EXISTS script [script ...]

### SCRIPT FLUSH
